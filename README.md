### Setup virtual environment in project

In Windows CMD, ensure you are in the folder of your repository

1. Run `python â€“m venv venv`
2. Run `venv\Scripts\activate` 
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

All required packages should have been installed!

`venv\Scripts\activate` is also the <b>command to enter your virtual environment</b> whenever you want to run the application on CMD

Once the requirements have been added, you can run the streamlit app by
`streamlit run app.py`
